# Prevent In-World Writes

Project Zomboid Mod. This mod forces players to pick up notebooks from the ground before writing to them, to circumvent a Project Zomboid saving bug.

Due to a Project Zomboid bug, notebook content will not be saved unless the notebook is picked up and placed back down.
This can lead to accidental loss of writings between server restarts when said writing is done without picking up the notebook first.

This mod replaces the "Write on" option with a "Read" option if the notebook is on the ground, and adds an additional "Write on Notebook (Grab)" option that will first pick up the item and then open the writing window.
