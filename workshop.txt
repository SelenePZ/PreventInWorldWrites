title=Prevent In-World Writes
description=This mod forces players to pick up notebooks from the ground before writing to them, to circumvent a Project Zomboid saving bug.
description=
description=Due to a Project Zomboid bug, notebook content will not be saved unless the notebook is picked up and placed back down.
description=This can lead to accidental loss of writings between server restarts when said writing is done without picking up the notebook first.
description=
description=This mod replaces the "Write on" option with a "Read" option if the notebook is on the ground, and adds an additional "Write on Notebook (Grab)" option that will first pick up the item and then open the writing window.
